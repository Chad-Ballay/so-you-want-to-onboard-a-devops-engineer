* Have internet access sorted out for new starts or let them know if there isn't any.
* Locker access (if you supply lockers for hot-desk environments).
* Let security know that they are coming.
* Let people know if they are required to use their own equipment or are being supplied with specified equipment and what Operating System.
* If you haven't already done so adopt some Group Chat software like [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) or [Rocket Chat](https://rocket.chat/) this kind of software is beneficial to all and reduces pressure on key individuals because your questions go out to a group of people rather than target specific individuals who may be busy and under constant interruption.
  * If you do the above try and implement some [communications etiquette](https://hiverhq.com/blog/slack-etiquette/), for example when you answer someone create the answer in a thread so the questions, context, conversation and possibly solution are kept in the same place rather than being strewn throughout the chat history.
  * Provide a High-level Environment overview so new starts know what they are working on and what technologies they need to get up to speed on.
