## Culture

<summary>Aim to create a culture of empathy and psychological safety </summary>

* Embrace the standard of [The Humble Learner](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/myth-sufficiently-smart-engineer-aaron-blohowiak/), The Humble Learner accepts the limits of human capacity while seeking to grow their technical and empathetic skills
* Do not create nor foster a [Blame, Shame and Train](https://www.ehstoday.com/safety/your-safety-strategy-blame-shame-and-train) culture where mistakes are handled by openly blaming and shaming the employee (and sometimes terminating their employment) and then train other employees using the incident as an example
  * Instead recognise each failure for what it is, a lesson, identify what went wrong and how we can ensure it does not go wrong again (and no, this does not mean this is an excuse to produce lots more documentation:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)
* Try to foster a culture of improvement, benchmark your organisation against some form of [maturity model](https://devopsadoptmeth.wordpress.com/method-description/devops-maturity-model/) to identify the gaps and attempt to close them.
* Introduce the new engineer(s) to the relevant people within the organisation
* Remember not everyone may be as smart as you are, they may be missing
  * Context / Situational awareness (how did we get from here to there?)
  * Tribal Knowledge (This is where our ancestors bodies are buried)
  * Cultural awareness (How we do things around here)
  * [Technical Expertise in that specific problem domain](https://team-manual.cloud.service.gov.uk/team/orientation/#avoid-assuming-expertise)
  * The local Taxonomy - concepts and language does vary from work place to work place. e.g. pre-approved changes and standard changes many not necessarily mean the same thing from job to job.
* What are the Preferred practices or ["Design Principles"](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles)?
* Listen to their point of view. Bringing in a new person is a prime opportunity to find out where the code or process needs improvement.
* Test your mentoring and on boarding process to flush out any shortfalls by getting the last person who joined to mentor the new joiner.
* Make your documentation inclusive e.g. this document is parsed using [alex](http://alexjs.com/) in order to catch insensitive and inconsiderate writing.
* Be wary of not overloading new starts with too much information. There is often quite a lot to learn (often more than you think), instead provide a set of useful links so people can research at their own pace.
* Write code that takes into account how future maintainers will feel reading it, let your code be [empathetic](https://www.benjaminjohnson.me/empathetic-code/).
