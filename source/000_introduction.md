# So you want to Onboard a DevOps Practitioner

## Introduction

Currently everyone seems to be very interested in recruiting DevOps practitioners but I feel the process of on-boarding them and giving them a supportive environment to be able to succeed and thrive is still a bit of hit and miss affair, especially in busy organisations.

Nobody (at least nobody I know…) *wants* to work in a difficult environment:

* Bad environments (and [broken cultures](https://julesx.com/toxic-work-culture-forcing-best-employees-quit/)) do not attract nor retain top talent it does the exact opposite.
