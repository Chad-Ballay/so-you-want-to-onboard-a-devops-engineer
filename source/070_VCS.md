## Version control management

<summary>How do we safely change the things</summary>

* Document your coding standards and strategies in the open e.g.
  * [Version control & branch strategy](https://www.infoq.com/articles/agile-version-control)
  * Code review process
  * Release handling management
* Have an Up to date [README](https://thejunkland.com/blog/how-to-write-good-readme.html) documentation in all repos for [example](https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices/)
  * :+1: have [sequence diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram) in all repos e.g. [plantuml](http://plantuml.com/) or [mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/)
  * :+1: have [Architecture Decision Records](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) in your [repos](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools)
  * :+1: Have a Clear and concise [git history](http://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/good-pull-requests.html) that [clearly](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) and easily documents the changes done and the reasons why in your repositories
* Make [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) a first class citizen, nothing is more demoralising than having a Pull Request sitting around without [feedback](https://devchecklists.com/pull-requests-checklist/) and a chance of being merged especially if it needs to be continually rebased.
* Good [Pull Requests](https://github.com/alphagov/frontend/pull/784) can also be an excellent teaching tool for new starts or old hands alike, a good PR tell's you what was implemented, why and how, so if you (or anyone else) need to do something similar in the future it will make things a lot easier than relying on your memory or tribal knowledge. You can also prompt for good Pull Requests by using [Pull Request Templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html) that suggest your best practice format.
* If you use [slack](https://slack.com) or something similar consider adding a notification bot for pull request and push activities, e.g. for [bitbucket](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1213042/slack-notifications-plugin?hosting=server&tab=overview) or [github](https://github.com/Talkdesk/pr-police) to notify your colleagues that a Pull Request is ready for review.
* Keep your pull request list short and tidy, [merge good requests quickly](https://medium.com/@biratkirat/step-52-let-your-project-speak-for-itself-daniel-lindner-e45a0b1ce2c7) and close poor ones or those that are never going to be merged.
* Integrate your git history with your external issue tracker so that it can automatically reference the changes related to a story and put in place some [automated branch naming pattern protection](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-protected-branches) to ensure that any branches match the issue trackers issue reference format, this way you enforce the best practice of a branch matching a historical record in (for example) Jira as to why something was created, changed or deleted.
